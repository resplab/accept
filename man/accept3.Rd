  smoker,
  mMRC,
  CVD,

\arguments{
\item{country}{Three-letter ISO country code (e.g., "CAN", "USA", "GBR"). 
Supported countries: ARG, AUS, BRA, CAN, COL, DEU, DNK, ESP, FRA, GBR, ITA, JPN, KOR, MEX, NLD, NOR, SWE, USA.
For unsupported countries, observed moderate-to-severe risk is used for recalibration.}

\item{ID}{A unique character string identifying the patient}

\item{age}{Patient's age (40-90 years)}

\item{male}{Whether the patient is male (TRUE/FALSE)}

\item{BMI}{Body mass index (10-60)}

\item{smoker}{Whether the patient is currently a smoker (TRUE/FALSE)}

\item{mMRC}{Modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (0-4)}

\item{CVD}{Whether the patient has cardiovascular disease (TRUE/FALSE)}

\item{ICS}{Whether the patient is on inhaled corticosteroids (TRUE/FALSE)}

\item{LABA}{Whether the patient is on long acting beta agonist (TRUE/FALSE)}

\item{LAMA}{Whether the patient is on long acting muscarinic antagonist (TRUE/FALSE)}

\item{LastYrExacCount}{Total number of exacerbations in the previous year}

\item{LastYrSevExacCount}{Number of severe exacerbations in the previous year}

\item{FEV1}{Forced expiratory volume in 1 second in percent predicted (10-120)}

\item{oxygen}{Whether the patient has had supplemental oxygen therapy within the past year (TRUE/FALSE)}

\item{obs_modsev_risk}{Observed moderate-to-severe exacerbation risk in the local population. 
Only used for countries not in the supported list. If NA, country-specific intercept is used.}
}
\value{
When called directly, returns a character string with recalibrated risks. 
  When called through \code{accept()} with version="accept3", returns a tibble with:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{predicted_exac_probability}: Recalibrated probability of moderate-to-severe exacerbation
    \item \code{predicted_exac_rate}: Recalibrated rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbation (calculated as -log(1-p))
    \item \code{predicted_severe_exac_probability}: Recalibrated probability of severe exacerbation
    \item \code{predicted_severe_exac_rate}: Recalibrated rate of severe exacerbation (calculated as -log(1-p))
  }
}
\description{
This function provides country-specific exacerbation risk predictions by applying 
recalibration adjustments to the ACCEPT 2.0 model. It accounts for differences in 
healthcare systems, diagnostic practices, and baseline risk across 18 countries.
}
\details{
ACCEPT 3.0 builds upon ACCEPT 2.0 by adding country-specific recalibration to improve 
prediction accuracy across diverse healthcare settings. The model uses empirically-derived 
country-specific intercepts for 18 countries. For other countries, users can provide 
observed local risk data for recalibration.

The recalibration applies transformation slopes of 0.9162 for moderate-to-severe 
exacerbations and 0.9626 for severe exacerbations.
